Stream Everything Is

+++
![Array vs stream](presentation/assets/arrayVsStream.png)

Note:
In general, we can think of streams as values over time. If we compare it to an array, with an array we have all the
values toghether in a single time, while a stream we get new values as the time passes. Note that these values can be
arrays, or even other streams (so you can have an array of arrays or a stream of arrays or a stream of streams)

Arrays are used to hold a group of values. Streams represent new values over time. That's why they are specially suitable
for events, or data that changes over time.

## Operators

- filter
- map
- reduce
- take
- buffer
- combineLatest
- concat
- debounce
- distinct
- publish

Note:
There are over 100 operators, but these are the most often used (or variations of these, like scan, bufferTime, throttle, debounceTime, etc. )
We can also define our own operators so we can use them everywhere we need, but most of what usually needs to be done can be
covered using the new ones.

## A few name BC

Note:
Reserved JS names (if => iif, throw => throwError, do => tap, catch => catchError, etc.)
some instance methods to static methods (merge, concat, combineLatest, zip, etc.)

## rxjs-compat

Note:
To make migration easier we can use rxjs-compat, which brings old v5 API to v6. We still need to handle something though - Custom Operators

+++?code=presentation/assets/src/customOperators.js&lang=js&title=Custom Operators
@title[Custom Operators]

@[1-7](Old custom operator)
@[9-12](Old usage)
@[14-18](New custom operator)
@[19,20](Named operators)
@[22-27](New usage)

Note:
"Named operators" can be now used and they make sense, whereas before you shouldn't assume the type of the data when adding operators to the prototype (b/c it's being used in all types of Observable). And it works in TS
Sidenote - gitpitch only shows 61x14 window of code
Question => Does tslint tool migrate custom operators (defined in prototype) => No it doesn't, just basic boilerplate stuff (imports, pipes, method names)
